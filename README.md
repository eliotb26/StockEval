## Metrics
- DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)
        def dcf(growth_rate, WACC):
        cf_list = []
        for i in range(0, 4):
            cf = CF0 * (1.05 ** i)
            discounted = cf/(WACC ** i)
            cf_list.append(discounted)
    
        TCF = (cf_list[-1] * WACC^5)/ (WACC - growth rate)
        cf_list.append(TCF)
        PV = sum(cf_list)
        return PV
- Absolute Valuation
- P/E ratios
    - comaprisions between similar companies in the industry 
- Present Value 
    - PV = CF1 / (1+r)  +  CF2 / (1+r)^2  +  â€¦ [TCF / (r - g)] / (1+k)^n-1
    
    - CF (Cash flow growth)
    - r = Discount Rate
    - g = Growth Rate 
    - TCF = Terminal year cash flow (TCF = CFn / (r-g))
    - n = Number of periods in the valuation model


## Bonds
