### Local API Key File 
Consistently stored in `~/.nasdaq/data_link_apikey` the client will attempt to load this file if it exists. Note: if the file exists and empty, a ValueError will be thrown.


## Metrics
- DCF (Discounted Cash Flow)
        def dcf(growth_rate, WACC):
        cf_list = []
        for i in range(0, 4):
            cf = CF0 * (1.05 ** i)
            discounted = cf/(WACC ** i)
            cf_list.append(discounted)
    
        TCF = (cf_list[-1] * WACC^5)/ (WACC - growth rate)
        cf_list.append(TCF)
        PV = sum(cf_list)
        return PV
- Absolute Valuation
- P/E ratios
    - comaprisions between similar companies in the industry 
- Present Value 
    - PV = CF1 / (1+r)  +  CF2 / (1+r)^2  +  â€¦ [TCF / (r - g)] / (1+k)^n-1
    
    - CF (Cash flow growth)
    - r = Discount Rate
    - g = Growth Rate 
    - TCF = Terminal year cash flow (TCF = CFn / (r-g))
    - n = Number of periods in the valuation model


## Monte Carlo 
- Create simulations and test data from 2010-2020 and test vs real data from 2020-2022 and see how well they fit
    - or even from 2000-2010 and see how well that fits from 2010-2020

1. Price Simulation: Generate random price paths based on a stock's historical volatility to simulate potential future stock prices.

2. Return Simulation: Generate random return paths based on a stock's historical returns to simulate potential future returns.

3. Value at Risk (VaR) Simulation: Estimate the potential maximum loss in a portfolio using Monte Carlo simulation to model the distribution of possible returns.

4. Option Pricing Simulation: Simulate the price of an option using a random walk model and calculate its expected value.

5. Portfolio Optimization Simulation: Generate multiple portfolios with different combinations of assets and weights to identify the optimal portfolio based on expected returns and risk.

6. Scenario Analysis Simulation: Simulate various scenarios to understand how different economic, political, or market events could affect a portfolio.

7. Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis: Analyze how changes in key parameters such as volatility, interest rates, or inflation impact a portfolio's performance.

8. Volatility Smile Simulation: Simulate the implied volatility surface of a stock option and price the option based on the simulated implied volatility.

9. Monte Carlo Credit Risk Simulation: Simulate the potential losses on a credit portfolio due to default risk, based on the distribution of possible credit events.

10. Monte Carlo Retirement Planning Simulation: Simulate potential outcomes for retirement planning, based on a variety of factors such as investment returns, inflation, and spending habits.
